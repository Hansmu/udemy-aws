<h2>AWS Regions</h2>
AWS has regions all around the world. It's just what it says, a region somewhere in the world.
Ex us-east-1. Each region has their own data. So data that's stored in one region
doesn't automatically become accessible in another region.

Each region has availability zones. Ex. us-east-1a, us-east-1b. Each availability zone represents
a physical data center in the region. But they're physically separate from one another. Try and 
minimize threat from physical damage. Ex. disasters. They are still connected
with each other with a high bandwidth, ultra-low latency network.

AWS Consoles are region scoped (except IAM and S3). When you perform an action it will be 
performed in the specific region. Choose the closest region to you.

<h2>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</h2>
This is where the AWS security is.
* Users
* Groups
* Roles

Root account should never be used (and shared). Only use it for the very first time to
create an account and then never again.

**Users** are usually physical people. They are grouped into **groups**, usually by function, team
or something similar.

**Roles** are given to machines. They're for internal usage within AWS resources.

Policies are defined as JSON for those above entities. It defines what each of the above
can and cannot do. It's always good to give the users the minimal amount of permissions
they need to perform their job (least privilege principles).

Multi factor authentication can be setup. Additionally there are predefined policies, that 
can be used.

IAM Federation is something that big enterprises can use. It integrates their own repository
of users with IAM. This way people can use their corporate logins in AWS. It uses the SAML
standard (Active Directory).

So the basic rules are:
* One IAM User per PHYSICAL PERSON
* One IAM Role per Application
* IAM credentials should never be shared
* Never write IAM credentials in code
* Never use ROOT account except for initial setup
* Never use ROOT IAM credentials

Permissions should be applied using groups, as it's more easily manageable. 
The users are put into groups from which they extend permissions.

IAM password policy can be applied to make sure that the users create strong 
passwords.

<h2>EC2</h2>

It consists of:
* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
* Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

The first part of creating an image is choosing an operating system for the machine.
Amazon Linux comes with a lot of Amazon features and it's kind of the way that 
Amazon imagines you using the services, so it's a good place to start.

Then you have to select the type, which means how powerful your machine should be.

Tags can be added to make identifying the instance easier.

With EC2 connect behind the scenes AWS will generate a key to connect to 
it temporarily. If SSH is turned off, then it won't work. It works using
Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

Elastic IP can be used to give an EC2 machine a static IP. It can be attached
to a single machine at a time. By default the EC2 IP can change with each 
restart. This often reflects poor architectural decisions, so it would be
better to avoid it. Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name
to it. Or we can use a load balancer and not use a public IP at all.

Having an Elastic IP on your account, even if unassociated, will cost money.

<h2>Security Group</h2>
The fundamental of network security in AWS. They control how traffic is allowed 
into or out of our EC2 Machines. They are like the firewall for EC2 instances.

Inbound rules are used to control traffic coming in and outbound traffic is
used to define the traffic going out of the machine.

Security groups can be attached to multiple instances. They're locked to region
/VPC combination. It lives outside of the EC2 instance, so traffic that is blocked
is not visible in the EC2 instance.

**It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.**

If you get a timeout when trying to connect, then it's a security group issue.

If you get a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's
not launched.

By default all inbound traffic is blocked and all outbound traffic is allowed.

Security groups can be referenced from other security groups. This can be used
to allow other EC2 instances to connect to another EC2 instance without dealing
with IPs.

<h2>EC2 User Data</h2>
EC2 user data scripts can be used to bootstrap our instances. That is launching
commands when a machine starts. The script is run only once at the instance
first start. It runs with the sudo rights.
EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
* Installing updates
* Installing software
* Downloading common files from the internet
* Anything you can think of

Under `Configure details` you can find `User data` under `Advanced details`.
