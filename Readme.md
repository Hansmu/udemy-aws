<h2>AWS Regions</h2>
AWS has regions all around the world. It's just what it says, a region somewhere in the world.
Ex us-east-1. Each region has their own data. So data that's stored in one region
doesn't automatically become accessible in another region.

Each region has availability zones. Ex. us-east-1a, us-east-1b. Each availability zone represents
a physical data center in the region. But they're physically separate from one another. Try and 
minimize threat from physical damage. Ex. disasters. They are still connected
with each other with a high bandwidth, ultra-low latency network.

AWS Consoles are region scoped (except IAM and S3). When you perform an action it will be 
performed in the specific region. Choose the closest region to you.

<h2>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</h2>
This is where the AWS security is.
* Users
* Groups
* Roles

Root account should never be used (and shared). Only use it for the very first time to
create an account and then never again.

**Users** are usually physical people. They are grouped into **groups**, usually by function, team
or something similar.

**Roles** are given to machines. They're for internal usage within AWS resources.

Policies are defined as JSON for those above entities. It defines what each of the above
can and cannot do. It's always good to give the users the minimal amount of permissions
they need to perform their job (least privilege principles).

Multi factor authentication can be setup. Additionally there are predefined policies, that 
can be used.

IAM Federation is something that big enterprises can use. It integrates their own repository
of users with IAM. This way people can use their corporate logins in AWS. It uses the SAML
standard (Active Directory).

So the basic rules are:
* One IAM User per PHYSICAL PERSON
* One IAM Role per Application
* IAM credentials should never be shared
* Never write IAM credentials in code
* Never use ROOT account except for initial setup
* Never use ROOT IAM credentials

Permissions should be applied using groups, as it's more easily manageable. 
The users are put into groups from which they extend permissions.

IAM password policy can be applied to make sure that the users create strong 
passwords.

<h2>EC2</h2>

It consists of:
* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
* Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

The first part of creating an image is choosing an operating system for the machine.
Amazon Linux comes with a lot of Amazon features and it's kind of the way that 
Amazon imagines you using the services, so it's a good place to start.

Then you have to select the type, which means how powerful your machine should be.

Tags can be added to make identifying the instance easier.
