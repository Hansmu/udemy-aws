<h2>AWS Cloud Development Kid (CDK)</h2>
* Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language
    * JS/TS, Python, Java, and .NET
* Contains high level components called constructs
* The code is "compiled" into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
* You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
    * Great for Lambda functions
    * Great for Docker containers in ECS/EKS
